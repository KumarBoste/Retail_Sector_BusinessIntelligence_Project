# Retail Sector Business Intelligence Project
**Using TABLEAU**

## Objective of the Project
The primary objective of this project is to design an end-to-end Business Intelligence (BI) solution for the retail sector that enables management to:
- Monitor sales, profit, and target achievement
- Analyze customer segments and geographic performance
- Evaluate supply chain efficiency and delivery performance
- Identify top-performing products, platforms, and markets
- Support data-driven strategic decision-making

The project leverages interactive Tableau dashboards to convert raw transactional data into actionable business insights.

## Problem Statement
Retail businesses often face challenges such as:
- Lack of centralized visibility across sales, customers, and supply chain
- Difficulty tracking profitability by category, region, and platform
- Inefficient delivery timelines and high shipping costs
- Limited understanding of customer segments and buying behavior
- Poor alignment between sales performance and business targets

This project addresses these issues by building a multi-dashboard BI model that provides a 360-degree view of retail performance.

## Business Questions Based on Visualized Insights
#### Executive-Level Questions
1. What is the total sales and profit performance?
2. Are we achieving our sales targets?
3. How efficient is our average delivery time?

#### Sales & Product Questions
1. Which product categories generate the highest sales?
2. Who are the top 5 most profitable products?
3. Which sales platforms contribute most to revenue?

#### Customer & Market Questions
1. Which customer segment drives maximum sales?
2. How does sales vary across regions and countries?
3. Which markets have growth potential?

#### Supply Chain Questions
1. Which warehouses are most efficient?
2. Where do we face delivery delays?
3. How does shipping cost relate to delivery time?

## Statistical Analysis
The project applies the following analytical techniques:

#### Descriptive Statistics
- Total Sales, Profit, Quantity Shipped
- Average Delivery Days
- Percentage Target Achievement

#### Comparative Analysis
- Sales by Year
- Sales by Country and Market
- Segment-wise Revenue Comparison

#### Distribution & Trend Analysis
- Product category contribution using treemaps
- Year-over-year sales stability
- Platform-wise revenue distribution

#### Operational Metrics
- Delivered vs In-Transit vs Delayed shipments
- Warehouse shipment volumes
- Shipping cost vs delivery duration relationship

These analyses help identify patterns, outliers, and inefficiencies.
